# MBTA-Load-prediction-analysis
Data Science Project on Boston bus service real-time data 

Everyday millions of passengers use Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority
(abbreviated MBTA and known colloquially as "the T" ) for their commute. In 2021, the
system had a ridership of 160,557,600, or about 689,300 per weekday as of the second
quarter of 2022 making it the fourth-busiest transport system in the U.S. The MBTA bus
system, the nation's sixth largest by ridership, has over 170 routes. Most routes provide
local service in the urban core; smaller local networks are also centered around Waltham,
Lynn, and Quincy.
Greater Boston’s population has increased 53% in the last 50 years while the MBTA bus
fleet has decreased. The MBTA’s current operating fleet of 1,121 buses is smaller than it
was in 1972, when the agency operated 1,200 buses. While the MBTA has invested
significant resources to hire new bus operators, even if they double the current rate of
hiring, it could take up to two years to hire and train enough operators to bring bus
service up to the pre-pandemic level.

#Problem Definition: Apart from the above said challenges, it is also reported that the
MBTA needs 300 more drivers to meet its current schedule, plus another 440 for
its reshaped route map. Hence with this data analytics project, we are trying to help the
organization solve these problems by building a model to answer below questions:
1. What is the predicted load of a bus on a particular date and time?
2. What is the effective way to utilize bus drivers ?
3. Which bus route needs additional resources and to balance them?
